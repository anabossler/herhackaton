hospitals modified code at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZGB2tEkhVpue4l99nGl5Gz4MVHXhpBqF?authuser=1#scrollTo=xpUqO59W3pXb
geolocation code inspired by https://towardsdatascience.com/clustering-geospatial-data-f0584f0b04ec (Mauro Di Pietro)
Saw that we uploaded the wrong colab (so there is an output error in ad code- will upload the right version when have time to do it.
Will publish analysis with propensity score (saw a python library about it) to simulate patient profiles.
